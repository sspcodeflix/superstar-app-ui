# Superstar App UI is a state-of-the-art generative AI application built with ReactJS that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent document-based question answering. Users can easily upload documents via the UI, which are then processed to generate embeddings and stored in a Milvus vector database. This setup enables efficient retrieval of relevant information to answer user queries accurately and contextually.
